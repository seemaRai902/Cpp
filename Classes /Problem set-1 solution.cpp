// Problems:

// P1. Define a Person class like we did in the previous module. Only add name and age.

// P2. Create two instances of Person and call print_info() on them.

// P3. Make the attributes private and see if you can still access them from outside the class.

// P4. Add a class called Student that inherits from Person. Add a field called department. Add a constructor that takes a name, age and department. Add a method called print_info() that prints out the name, age and department of the student.

// P5. Create an instance of Student and call print_info() on it.

// P6. Create a class called Teacher that inherits from Person. Add a field called salary. Add a constructor that takes a name, age and salary. Add a method called print_info() that prints out the name, age and salary of the teacher.

// P7. Create an instance of Teacher and call print_info() on it.
